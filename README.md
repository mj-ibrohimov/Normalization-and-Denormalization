# Spotify Top Hits Database Denormalization Project

This project applies advanced database denormalization techniques to Spotify’s Top Hits playlists (2010-2022), optimizing raw data for analytical needs, efficient storage, and insightful trend analysis.

Overview
The goal of this project is to create a high-performance database optimized for analytical queries, providing insights into music trends and enabling efficient data storage and retrieval.

Features
Data Source: Based on Spotify’s top playlists, with data on tracks, artists, albums, genres, and playlists.
Normalization & Denormalization: Begins with a Third Normal Form (3NF) schema to ensure data consistency, then transitions to a denormalized structure with the “tracks” table as the central fact table.
Efficient Data Storage: Leverages storage and retrieval techniques for high-speed performance on large datasets.
Key Analyses

-- Average Danceability by Genre
-- Calculates average danceability metrics to enable personalized recommendations.

-- Top Tracks by Playlist
-- Displays the top three most popular tracks for each playlist.

-- Popularity Distribution
-- Calculates cumulative distribution of track popularity across each playlist.

Challenges & Insights
This project provided practical experience in dimensional modeling, data normalization, and denormalization. It was a rewarding challenge that combined theory with real-world data handling for optimized query performance and robust music trend analysis.
